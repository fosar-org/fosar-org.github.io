The Family of Shipyard Assisting Robotics (FOSAR) initiative represents a groundbreaking approach to advancing shipyard automation and robotics.

Designed to address the growing complexity of naval sustainment while fostering collaboration across the supply chain, FOSAR is positioned to play a transformative role in
shipyard operations in 2025. By leveraging modular, scalable, and flexible technologies,
FOSAR promotes innovation while ensuring compatibility across diverse platforms and
applications.

Key advancements within the FOSAR program in 2025 include the continued development of modular robotics platforms capable of scaling across multiple shipyard applications. A central focus is crawler robotics, where FOSAR’s efforts will improve durability and efficiency for tasks associated with hull inspection and maintenance.

These robotics systems will integrate technologies such as advanced sensors, robotic arms, and other modular devices. By designing robots that operate in challenging environments, the initiative will minimize the need for direct human involvement,
enhancing both safety and productivity.

Digital tools will also play a critical role, providing operators with intuitive interfaces to oversee operations and maintain consistent quality standards. The use of AI and machine learning will optimize robotic operations, enabling systems to adapt in real time to changing conditions.

Expanding the Shipyard Supply Chain

FOSAR is not just about robotics technology, it’s about reshaping the shipyard supply chain. By introducing a family of interoperable robotic systems, the initiative encourages collaboration between suppliers, contractors, and end-users. This approach simplifies integration, reduces duplication of effort, and accelerates the adoption of advanced solutions. For example, the use
of modular “building block” components—electronic, mechanical, and software systems—enables faster customization and broader application across shipyards.

Moreover, the initiative seeks to address workforce challenges by making shipyard jobs more appealing through the adoption of digital tools. By modernizing workflows and introducing robotics that assist rather than replace workers, FOSAR helps bridge the skills gap and ensures that shipyards remain competitive in attracting top talent.

Commercial Applications Beyond Shipyards

FOSAR’s technologies have profound implications for commercial industries facing similar challenges. Robotic Crawlers, for example, can be adapted for infrastructure maintenance, such as inspecting and repairing wind turbines, bridges, and high-rise buildings. Similarly, the modular robotics framework can streamline factory automation, enabling rapid adaptation to product changes and reducing the need for extensive retooling. UV light systems, initially designed for underwater biofouling prevention, could be employed in commercial settings like food production and healthcare to ensure hygienic surfaces and contamination control.

Boston Engineering’s ability to develop these technologies and foster collaboration across partners is a powerful testament to its problem-solving capabilities. By uniting suppliers, contractors, and developers under a shared vision, Boston Engineering has built a family of robotics that serves as a model for cross-industry innovation. This approach directly addresses the concerns of executives outside the military and shipyard sectors, especially those grappling with a shrinking workforce and disrupted supply chains.
