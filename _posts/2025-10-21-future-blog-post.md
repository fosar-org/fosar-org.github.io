The Family of Shipyard Assisting Robotics (FOSAR) initiative represents a groundbreaking approach to advancing shipyard
automation and robotics.

Designed to address the growing complexity of naval sustainment while fostering collaboration across the supply chain,
FOSAR is positioned to play a transformative role in
shipyard operations in 2025. By leveraging modular, scalable, and flexible technologies,
FOSAR promotes innovation while ensuring compatibility across diverse platforms and
applications.

<h3>
Technologies Driving FOSAR in 2025
</h3>

Key advancements within the FOSAR program in 2025 include the continued development of modular robotics platforms
capable of scaling across multiple shipyard applications. A central focus is crawler robotics, where FOSAR’s efforts
will improve durability and efficiency for tasks associated with hull inspection and maintenance.

These robotics systems will integrate technologies such as advanced sensors, robotic arms, and other modular devices. By
designing robots that operate in challenging environments, the initiative will minimize the need for direct human
involvement,
enhancing both safety and productivity.

Digital tools will also play a critical role, providing operators with intuitive interfaces to oversee operations and
maintain consistent quality standards. The use of AI and machine learning will optimize robotic operations, enabling
systems to adapt in real time to changing conditions.

<h3>
Expanding the Shipyard Supply Chain
</h3>

FOSAR is not just about robotics technology, it’s about reshaping the shipyard supply chain. By introducing a family of
interoperable robotic systems, the initiative encourages collaboration between suppliers, contractors, and end-users.
This approach simplifies integration, reduces duplication of effort, and accelerates the adoption of advanced solutions.
For example, the use
of modular “building block” components—electronic, mechanical, and software systems—enables faster customization and
broader application across shipyards.

Moreover, the initiative seeks to address workforce challenges by making shipyard jobs more appealing through the
adoption of digital tools. By modernizing workflows and introducing robotics that assist rather than replace workers,
FOSAR helps bridge the skills gap and ensures that shipyards remain competitive in attracting top talent.

<h3>
Commercial Applications Beyond Shipyards
</h3>

FOSAR’s technologies have profound implications for commercial industries facing similar challenges. Robotic Crawlers,
for example, can be adapted for infrastructure maintenance, such as inspecting and repairing wind turbines, bridges, and
high-rise buildings. Similarly, the modular robotics framework can streamline factory automation, enabling rapid
adaptation to product changes and reducing the need for extensive retooling. UV light systems, initially designed for
underwater biofouling prevention, could be employed in commercial settings like food production and healthcare to ensure
hygienic surfaces and contamination control.

Boston Engineering’s ability to develop these technologies and foster collaboration across partners is a powerful
testament to its problem-solving capabilities. By uniting suppliers, contractors, and developers under a shared vision,
Boston Engineering has built a family of robotics that serves as a model for cross-industry innovation. This approach
directly addresses the concerns of executives outside the military and shipyard sectors, especially those grappling with
a shrinking workforce and disrupted supply chains.

<h3>
Looking Ahead
</h3>

For product development leaders, FOSAR exemplifies how Boston Engineering’s expertise can help design solutions that are
not only cutting-edge but also practical and scalable. The emphasis on modular, flexible systems ensures that commercial
enterprises can adapt quickly to market shifts, technological advancements, and workforce limitations. By adopting a
similar strategy, industries like manufacturing, logistics, and energy can achieve greater resilience and
efficiency, ensuring they remain competitive in an unpredictable world

As the engineering landscape continues to evolve, Boston Engineering is committed to proactively integrating
cutting-edge technologies and methodologies into the solutions it delivers, ensuring that clients stay at the forefront
of industry trends and maintain a competitive edge in 2025 and beyond.
